## Microservices

### TOURNI-UI

- A React application that leverages Hooks for state management and Material-UI for styling. It utilizes TypeScript for type safety and Axios for making HTTP requests.

### TOURNI-GATEWAY

- Routes incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate backend service, using Spring Cloud Gateway for intelligent routing and load balancing.

### TOURNI-CONFIG-SERVER

- Centralizes and manages external configurations for microservices, pulling from the TOURNI-CONFIG repository on GitHub.

### TOURNI-IDENTITY-SERVICE

- Handles user registration, login, and secure endpoint access with JWT tokens for stateless authentication.

### TOURNI-MANAGEMENT

- Facilitates various operations such as team and tournament addition, match result management, and points table management.

### TOURNI-AI (IN-PROGRESS)

- Enhances the tournament experience by providing strategic insights using OpenAI's GPT technology.

## Observability

Our platform uses Grafana for analytics and monitoring visualization, Loki for log aggregation, Prometheus for system monitoring, and Tempo for distributed tracing to maintain a high level of performance and reliability.

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for running all services
- 20GB+ disk space

## Quick Start

TOURNA-MATE supports three isolated environments: **Development**, **Staging**, and **Production**. Each environment runs on different ports to allow simultaneous operation.

### 🚀 Start Development Environment

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

**Access URLs:**
- UI: http://localhost:8002
- API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
- Service Discovery: http://localhost:8761
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

### 🧪 Start Staging Environment

```bash
./start-staging.sh
```

**Access URLs:**
- UI: http://localhost:9002
- API Gateway: http://localhost:9080
- Service Discovery: http://localhost:9761
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9091

### 🔒 Start Production Environment

```bash
./start-prod.sh
```

**Access URLs:**
- UI: http://localhost:10002
- API Gateway: http://localhost:10080
- Service Discovery: http://localhost:10761
- Grafana: http://localhost:3002
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9092

> ⚠️ **Note**: Production startup requires confirmation and uses strong passwords. Edit `docker/secrets/.env.prod` before first run.

## Environment Configuration

### Port Allocation

| Service | Development | Staging | Production |
|---------|------------|---------|------------|
| UI | 8002 | 9002 | 10002 |
| API Gateway | 8080 | 9080 | 10080 |
| Service Discovery | 8761 | 9761 | 10761 |
| Config Server | 8888 | 9888 | 10888 |
| Identity Service | 8082 | 9082 | 10082 |
| Management Service | 8083 | 9083 | 10083 |
| AI Service | 8084 | 9084 | 10084 |
| MySQL | 3306 | 3307 | 3308 |
| Grafana | 3000 | 3001 | 3002 |
| Prometheus | 9090 | 9091 | 9092 |
| Tempo | 3200, 9411 | 3201, 9412 | 3202, 9413 |
| Loki | 3100 | 3101 | 3102 |
| Vault | 8200 | 8201 | 8202 |

### Environment Variables

Each environment uses its own `.env` file located in `docker/secrets/`:
- Development: `.env.dev`
- Staging: `.env.staging`
- Production: `.env.prod`

**Key Variables:**
```bash
# Database
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<secure_password>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<secure_password>

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=<strong_secret_key>

# Monitoring
GRAFANA_PASSWORD=<admin_password>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password>
```

## Docker Architecture

### Optimized Docker Images

All services use production-ready Docker images with:
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime stages
- **Minimal base images**: Eclipse Temurin JRE (not JDK) for Java services
- **Non-root users**: Enhanced security with dedicated user accounts
- **Health checks**: Automatic health monitoring for all services
- **Resource limits**: Configured CPU and memory constraints

## Management Commands

### View Service Status

```bash
# Development
cd docker/dev && docker-compose ps

# Staging
cd docker/staging && docker-compose ps

# Production
cd docker/prod && docker-compose ps
```

### View Logs

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f tourni-gateway-dev
```

### Stop Environment

```bash
# Development
cd docker/dev && docker-compose down

# Staging
cd docker/staging && docker-compose down

# Production
cd docker/prod && docker-compose down

# Remove volumes (destructive)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Grafana Dashboards

Access Grafana at:
- Dev: http://localhost:3000
- Staging: http://localhost:3001
- Prod: http://localhost:3002

**Default Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: Check `docker/secrets/.env.<environment>` for `GRAFANA_PASSWORD`

### Metrics & Tracing

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and querying
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing visualization
- **Loki**: Log aggregation and search
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Application health and metrics endpoints

## Security

### Credentials Management

All sensitive credentials are stored in:
1. **Vault**: Runtime secrets (MySQL passwords, JWT secrets)
2. **Environment Files**: Configuration variables (in `docker/secrets/`)

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Change all default passwords in `.env.prod`
- [ ] Use strong JWT secrets (min 64 characters)
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for external access
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Use secrets management service (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- [ ] Regular security audits and updates

## Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

```bash
# Check service logs
docker-compose logs <service-name>

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart <service-name>

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build <service-name>
```

### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Verify MySQL is healthy
docker-compose ps tourni-mysql-dev

# Check MySQL logs
docker-compose logs tourni-mysql-dev

# Verify credentials in .env file
cat docker/secrets/.env.dev | grep MYSQL
```

### Port Already in Use

If ports are already occupied, either:
1. Stop the conflicting service
2. Modify ports in the docker-compose file
3. Use a different environment (dev/staging/prod)
